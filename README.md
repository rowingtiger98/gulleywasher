The GulleyWasher Project

The gulleywasher project has two main goals. The first is to figure out how to integrate Stripe Merchant services into a Bluehost shared host server in order to provide simple Merchant Services (MS) to the NSXMeetup domain. Once we have MS services tied into the hosting platform, the goal will be to create a UI / UX environment for event management that will allow users to tailor their registration experience. 

The second stretch goaal is a serve as a sandbox where we will try and create a replacement web site for the NSX club of America's current web site. The NSXCA's current with is hosted on Wild Apricot and is just terrible. There are parts of the site that are useful, namely merchant services and email abilities, but the UI / UX experience is dated, at best. 

We are looking to do a few approches here (maybe):

1) We could try and use the existing API's in WA that would allow us to use their back end to build a better front end. In short, use there database, their MS and their email abilities and just build the UX from API calls. This work involves a lot of authentication work into WA.

2) We try and replace the entire thing with out own system. The challenge here is to determine the level of CMS we could build that would allow board members (and other approved members) to create / edit / delete content, including layouts and styling, for the site.
